# Movie-Like Category Posters

For the best results, add proper movie-like poster images for each category. The images should be in portrait orientation (2:3 ratio), similar to movie posters.

## Required Images

Place the following images in this directory:

1. `/public/images/category-comedy.webp` - Modern comedy show poster
2. `/public/images/category-amusement.webp` - Amusement park attractions
3. `/public/images/category-theatre.webp` - Theatre/drama performances 
4. `/public/images/category-kids.webp` - Children's activities
5. `/public/images/category-music.webp` - Music concerts/performers
6. `/public/images/category-sports.webp` - Sports events

## Image Specifications

- **Format:** WebP (preferred for web) or JPG
- **Dimensions:** 600x900px (2:3 aspect ratio)
- **Style:** Similar to movie posters with clear subject focus
- **Text:** No text overlay (category name is added via CSS)

## Design Guidelines

- Use vibrant, high-quality images that clearly represent each category
- Images should have good contrast to ensure text readability when overlaid
- Use professional-looking images with good lighting and composition
- Avoid images that are too busy or have distracting elements
