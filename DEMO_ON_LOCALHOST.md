## 🆘 IF LOCALHOST DOESN'T SHOW DATA

### Check 1: Server Running?
Look for this in terminal:
```
✓ Ready in 2.5s
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Check 2: Database Connected?
The data is there (I just verified it). If pages show empty:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for `[FloorPlan List]` or `[Registration]` logs
3. Check for any red errors

### Check 3: Hard Refresh
Press: **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows)
