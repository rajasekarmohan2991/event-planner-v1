I have deployed a special repair tool to fix your database issues automatically.

**You do NOT need to use Supabase SQL Editor anymore.**

## 🚀 HOW TO FIX EVERYTHING:

### **Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2 minutes)**
Wait until approx 2:37 PM (current time + 2 mins) for the latest code to be live.

### **Step 3: Check Result**
You should see a JSON response like:
```json

  "success": true,
