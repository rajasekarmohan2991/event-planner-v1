## 💡 Pro Tips

### Get Better AI Results
✅ **DO:**
- Write descriptive event descriptions (50+ words)
- Include keywords like "beginner-friendly", "networking", "hands-on"
- Mention special features (free admission, certificates, food)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use very short descriptions (AI needs context)
- Leave description blank
- Use only generic text

### Keyword Magic
The AI detects these keywords and enhances content:
- **"beginner"** or **"new"** → Adds beginner-friendly note
- **"advanced"** or **"expert"** → Highlights expert content
- **"network"** or **"connect"** → Emphasizes networking
- **"free"** → Adds free admission highlight
- **"food"** or **"refreshment"** → Mentions refreshments
- **"certificate"** → Highlights certification

### Example Description
```
Join us for a beginner-friendly workshop on web development. 
This hands-on session includes free refreshments and a 
certificate of completion. Perfect for networking with fellow 
developers!
```

This will trigger:
- ✅ Beginner-friendly note
- ✅ Hands-on emphasis
- ✅ Free refreshments highlight
- ✅ Certificate mention
- ✅ Networking opportunities
